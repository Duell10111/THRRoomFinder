- Maptiler API Key (used for light theme of map):
  For development you can [create](https://www.maptiler.com/) a free account and use the API Key from there, the quota should be enough for your use case.
- Indoor Equal (used to fetch indoor map tiles):
  Free API Key can be generated with your email address from [here](https://indoorequal.com/).

  An API Key can be fetched after creating your own Firebase project for development.
  
  **Important**: You should change the authDomain as well when creating your own project to get the auth working.
