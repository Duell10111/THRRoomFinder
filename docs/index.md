THRRoomfinder is a helpful tool designed to assist students, staff, and visitors in quickly finding rooms and lecture halls on campus. Whether you‚Äôre late for a lecture or looking for a seminar room you‚Äôve never heard of‚ÄîRoomfinder has you covered.

You can access the latest version here: [https://thrroomfinder.duell10111.de/](https://thrroomfinder.duell10111.de/).  
To save costs, the instance shuts down when idle. As a result, the first load may take a few seconds if the site hasn't been accessed recently. You may need to refresh once, as the backend starts only after a request from the frontend has been made.

### üîç Features

- Campus Map Integration: Visual guidance on where the room is located.

You need the following API keys to build and run the application successfully:

- Maptiler API Key (used for light theme of map):
  For development you can [create](https://www.maptiler.com/) a free account and use the API Key from there, the quota should be enough for your use case.
- Indoor Equal (used to fetch indoor map tiles):
  You can generate a free API key using your email address from [Indoor Equal](https://indoorequal.com/).
- Firebase API Key (used for IDP authentication for admin dashboard):
  An API key can be obtained by creating your own Firebase project for development.

  **Important**: Make sure to also update the `authDomain` in your Firebase configuration to enable authentication.
